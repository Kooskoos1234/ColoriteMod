# ColoriteMod
My Minecraft mod, the Colorite Mod
This mod was made mostly as a coding experience for me, as well as a mod to play around with, but it turned into something I really wanted to do.
The mod wasn't supposed to be a standard old mod for the sake of it, or a special one for the sake of it. It was just made to be made, so I hope you enjoy it!
